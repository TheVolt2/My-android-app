# Pizza Ordering App 
 
The Pizza Ordering App is a simple mobile application developed using the Kivy library in Python. This app allows users to browse through a selection of pizzas and beverages, and place an order. 
 
## Features 
 
1. Pizza Selection: Users can choose from a variety of pizza options, including Pepperoni, Margherita, and Hawaiian. 
 
2. Beverage Selection: The app also offers a range of beverages such as Cola, Fanta, and Juice. 
 
3. Order Placement: After making their selections, users can finalize their order and view a summary including the chosen items and the total price. 
 
4. User-Friendly Interface: The app features a vertical layout designed for easy use on a mobile device. 
 
## Technical Details 
 
The app is built using the Kivy framework for the graphical user interface. It uses the BoxLayout to organize the UI components in a vertical orientation. The classes Pizza, Beverage, and Order are used to represent the pizza and beverage options, as well as manage the user's order. 
 
## Next Steps 
 
Future enhancements to the app may include the ability to customize pizza toppings, integrate payment and delivery options, and incorporate user authentication for order tracking. 
 
Overall, the Pizza Ordering App provides a simple and intuitive way for users to place orders for their favorite pizzas and beverages through a mobile interface.
