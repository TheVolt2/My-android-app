# Timer Project

## Description:

This project is a timer application created using Python and Flask framework. The timer allows users to set a specific amount of time and start the countdown. Once the timer reaches zero, the user will be notified through a sound alert or a pop-up notification.

## Features:

- Start, pause, and reset the timer
- Sound alert or pop-up notification when the timer reaches zero

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Flask framework
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation Instructions:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Flask using pip install Flask
3. Run the application using python app.py

## Usage:

1. Set the desired amount of time on the timer
2. Click on the start button to begin the countdown
3. Pause or reset the timer as needed
4. Wait for the sound alert or pop-up notification when the timer reaches zero

## Future Improvements:

- Add the ability to set multiple timers
- Customize the sound alert and notification options
- Implement user authentication and save timer settings for each user
